APOTSA: INDIA'S FINANCIAL OPERATIONS
PLATFORM
Strategic Implementation Plan - Bare Minimum MVP Approach

**Current goal- we've aligned on this: the goal is a polished investor demo — not production. A working demo that looks and feels real enough that a CFO can see themselves using it. No real transactions, dummy card UI, but everything wired to real backend/DB.
New 10-day deadline starting today (Day 1).
Day 1-2: Auth end-to-end working — login → JWT → role-based redirect to correct dashboard (Admin/Manager/Employee). Seed 3 demo accounts now.
Day 3-4: Expense CRUD + approval flow — employee submits, manager approves/rejects, admin sees all.
Day 5: Cards UI — virtual card display per employee, spend limit, available balance, company wallet on admin side. Make it look premium.
Day 6: Admin analytics dashboard — spend by department, budget bars, top spenders, pending approvals. Use recharts.
Day 7: GST auto-calculation on expenses + policy violation flags + finance review queue.
Day 8: Full design revamp — reference Ramp.com and Brex.com. Use shadcn/ui if not already added. Dark mode, clean tables, proper empty states, loading skeletons.
Day 9: Seed realistic demo data — fake company 'Nexus Technologies Pvt Ltd', 15 employees, 3 departments, 2 months expense history, pending approvals, policy violations.
Day 10: Buffer, polish, full demo flow test across all 3 roles, deploy on Vercel + Render, record Loom for Mohit.**


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Opportunity: India's 60M SMBs represent a $10B+ spend management market. 
We're building the spend control software with virtual cards that Indian businesses 
desperately need—starting with the absolute bare minimum to prove market fit fast.
The Business Model: We provide web-based spend management software and virtual 
corporate cards. Companies load credits, employees spend with full control and 
visibility. We monetize through (1) software subscription fees and (2) per-transaction 
costs.
The MVP Strategy: Launch web-only platform in 60 days with core features: virtual 
cards (dummy for now), expense tracking, spend controls, and real-time dashboard. 
Cards showcase future capability to investors while we nail the software experience 
first.
WHY NOW: THE PERFECT INFLECTION POINT
India's spend management market mirrors what the US experienced 5 years ago when 
Ramp launched. Three macro forces converge:
Force Impact
UPI Normalization Digital payments are default. Businesses expect 
instant, trackable transactions.
GST Digitization Tax compliance demands digital records. Manual 
expense tracking is a liability.
SMB Scaling Funded startups grow 50-200 employees in 18 months.
Finance teams can't keep up.

PHASE 1: MVP - BARE MINIMUM (60 DAYS)
Philosophy: Ship the minimum viable product that proves market demand. Cards are 
dummy/visual for investor credibility, but the software solves real pain today.
Core Products to Launch
1. Virtual Corporate Cards (Dummy/Visual MVP)
• Display virtual card interface (card number, CVV, expiry)
• Show spend limits and category restrictions (non-functional for MVP)
• Mock card issuance flow to demonstrate UX to investors
• Backend hooks ready for future RazorpayX/Cashfree integration
Why Dummy Cards First: Banking partnerships take 3-6 months. Cards impress 
investors and show vision, but expense software is the wedge that proves market need 
immediately.
2. Expense Tracking & Submission (CORE VALUE)
• Manual expense entry: amount, category, vendor, receipt upload
• Basic OCR for receipts (Google Vision API or Tesseract)
• Auto-categorization based on vendor name (simple keyword matching)
• GST-compliant transaction logging (CGST/SGST/IGST fields)
3. Spend Controls & Approval Workflows
• Department-level budgets (e.g., Marketing: ₹5L/month)
• Multi-level approvals: Employee → Manager → Finance
• Auto-approve rules (e.g., <₹5,000 auto-approved)
• Policy violation flags (manual review queue for finance team)
4. Real-Time Dashboard (Finance Team View)
• Live spend by department and category
• Budget utilization (% spent vs. allocated)
• Top spenders and top vendors
• Pending approvals queue

Minimal Technical Stack (Cost-Optimized)
Component Technology & Cost
Frontend React + Tailwind CSS (web-only, no mobile). Free.
Backend Node.js + Express. Deploy on Render/Railway free tier 
initially.
Database PostgreSQL (Supabase free tier: 500MB). Upgrade at scale.
File Storage Cloudinary free tier (10GB, 25k transformations/month) for 
receipts.
OCR Google Vision API (1,000 free requests/month, then 
$1.50/1,000). Or open-source Tesseract for zero cost.
Payments Dummy card UI for now. Future: Razorpay/Cashfree API (no 
upfront cost).
Total Monthly Cost (MVP): ₹0-₹2,000 (~$0-25). Scales as we add customers.
REVENUE MODEL & UNIT ECONOMICS
How We Make Money
Revenue Stream Details
Software Subscription ₹399/user/month for Pro Plan. Includes: expense 
tracking, approvals, dashboard, GST compliance, 
unlimited expenses.
Per-Transaction Fee 1.5% on credit loaded to platform (e.g., company loads
₹10L → we earn ₹15,000).
Future: Card 
Interchange
2-2.5% of card transaction volume (once real cards 
launch). Shared with payment partner.

Example Customer Economics
Scenario: 100-employee startup, ₹20 Cr annual spend, 30 active users on platform
• Subscription Revenue: 30 users × ₹399/month × 12 = ₹1,43,640/year
• Transaction Fees: ₹20 Cr loaded × 1.5% = ₹30,00,000/year
• Total Annual Revenue: ₹31,43,640 (~$34,800) per customer
Unit Economics:
• CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): ₹30,000 (outbound sales + onboarding)
• Payback Period: 3 months
• LTV (3-year retention): ₹34,30,920 (~$41,000)
• LTV:CAC Ratio: 11:1 (healthy SaaS benchmark is 3:1+)
GO-TO-MARKET: FIRST 100 CUSTOMERS
Phase 1: Launch Strategy (Months 1-3)
Target Customer Profile (ICP)
• Series A/B funded startups (50-200 employees)
• Annual spend: ₹5-50 Cr
• Verticals: SaaS, D2C, EdTech, FinTech, Logistics

• Pain: Managing 50+ employee expenses manually each month
Outbound as Primary Channel
Build targeted list of 500 companies using LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Crunchbase, 
Tracxn. Personal outreach to CFO/Finance Heads:

reduction"
• Offer: 3-month free pilot with hands-on onboarding
• Cadence: 20 emails/day, 5 LinkedIn messages/day, phone follow-up after 3 days
Free Tier for Viral Adoption
• Basic expense tracking (up to 10 users, 100 expenses/month)
• No credit card required to start
• Upgrade to Pro when they hit limits or need advanced features

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
1. Speed of Execution
Ship MVP in 60 days, not 6 months. Every feature takes max 2 weeks. Weekly product 
reviews: What shipped? What's next? Kill features that don't move metrics after 1 
month.
2. Outbound-First GTM
Ramp's 25% of pipeline came from outbound. We do the same: high-touch, value-driven
conversations with CFOs. No spray-and-pray.
3. India-Specific Wedges
Tally integration is our Trojan horse (80% of SMBs use it). GST compliance automation 
is existential. These aren't nice-to-haves—they're survival.
4. Lock-in Through Integration
Once we sync with Tally and handle approvals, switching cost becomes prohibitively 
high. Multi-product adoption (cards + software) creates stickiness.
5. AI as Future Moat
By Q4, launch AI policy agent that auto-approves/flags expenses with 99% accuracy. 
This becomes the defensible IP that legacy players can't replicate.

KEY RISKS & MITIGATION
Risk Mitigation
Banking partnership delays (6-12 
months)
Launch with software-first MVP. Cards 
dummy/visual for investors. Real cards 
in Q3.
Tally integration complexity Hire Tally-certified developer in month 1.
Build MVP connector in 6 weeks, beta 
test with 5 customers.
SMB adoption friction (tech-averse 
CFOs)
Free tier + white-glove onboarding for 
first 50 customers. Weekly NPS checks,
iterate UX.
Funded competition (Razorpay, Karbon) Move fast on AI features (12-month 
advantage). Lock first 100 customers 
with annual contracts.
CONCLUSION: THE $10B OPPORTUNITY
India's 60M SMBs are suffering from manual expense chaos. The macro conditions—
UPI normalization, GST digitization, rapid scaling—create the perfect storm for a 
software-first spend management platform.
Ramp proved the model works: $32B valuation in 6 years by focusing on efficiency over
rewards. India's market is 2x larger, yet woefully underserved.
Our approach is radically focused:
• Ship expense software in 60 days (cards are visual MVP for investors)
• Lock first 10 customers with white-glove onboarding
• Scale to 300 customers by year-end through outbound + free tier
• Launch real cards in Q3 once banking partnerships secured
• Build AI moat by Q4 (policy agent, auto-approval)
This isn't about building "yet another fintech." This is about creating the financial 
operating system for 60 million Indian businesses—and capturing a $10B+ market
in the process.
